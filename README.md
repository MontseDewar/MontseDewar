# Hi there 👋 I'm Montse ✨
<image align="center" alt="Banner" src="GitHub_Banner.gif">
I'm a psychologist with a passion for technology. My current journey in the digital world has mostly being exploring Front End development, however I'm interested in Data Science as well! <br />
I'm deeply intrigued by the intersection of psychology and technology and how it shapes our digital experiences.

### 💻 Front End
As a Front End enthusiast, I love crafting engaging user interfaces that not only look stunning but also provide seamless interactions. I believe that good design enhances user experience and fosters inclusivity in the digital realm

### 📊 Data Science & Data Visualization
In the realm of Data Science, I enjoy unraveling insights from complex datasets and transforming them into actionable strategies. Understanding human behavior through data analysis fascinates me, and I'm committed to leveraging this knowledge for building innovative solutions.<br />
Lately, I've been deeply inspired by [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) project.

### 🎨 Desing as a Visual Language
Beyond coding and data analysis, I'm drawn to the world of design as a powerful system of visual communication. I see design not only as an aesthetic endeavor but also as a means to convey ideas, emotions, and messages effectively.

### 🤔 What _about me_ rn?

- 🔭 I’m currently working on  ✨ _My first porfolio_ ✨ for digital proyects.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my Front End skills ✍🏻🤓

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love horror movies 👻 I think they allow us to explore these interesting feelings and ideas without being unsafe and from a place we can detached once the movie is done🎃
